# iris

## Introduction

This project is about clustering iris species using three different clustering algorithms: SVM, KNN and logistic regression. The dataset used is the iris dataset from kaggle [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset/). To tackle this problem, we will proceed as follows:

1. Data exploration analysis

2. Model building and evaluation

## Tools:

The project was mainly done using Python 3. The following libraries were used:

- `pandas` for data manipulation

- `numpy` for numerical computation

- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

- `sklearn` for machine learning

To install the libraries, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
